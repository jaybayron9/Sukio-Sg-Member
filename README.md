6. **Check-In/Check-Out**: Upon attending an event, use our QR code scanning feature to check in. Scan the event's unique QR code upon arrival and scan again when leaving to check out. 

## How to use the Check-In/Check-Out

- **QR Code Check-In**: To check in at an event, follow these steps:
  1. Click the "Check-In" button on your dashboard.
  2. The app will activate the camera for scanning the event's QR code.
  3. Hold your device steady and position it to scan the QR code displayed at the event venue.
  4. Once the QR code is successfully scanned, you will be checked in to the event.

    If you accidentally scan again the check-in qr it will show an error message indicating that you have already checked in.
